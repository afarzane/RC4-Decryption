# RC4-Decryption

Using an Altera DE2-115 board and the RC4 decryption algorithm, we decrypt the encrypted message "message.mif" in the main directory.

If using Quartus II, use "Tools->In System Memory Content Editor" to visualize all memory components, along with the RAM containing the decrypted message.
